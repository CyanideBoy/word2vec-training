# word2vec-training
CBOW model training tutorial I found online. <br>
A good blog on <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2017/10/15/learning-word-embedding.html">word2vec</a>. <br>
Mathematical results discussed <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.2738.pdf">here</a>. <br>
The training script does not use negative sampling as the data is not too much.
